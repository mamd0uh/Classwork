    <div class="rules-body">In some ways soccer is a fairly simple or pure game. The primary rule is that players cannot touch the ball with their hands or arms while the ball is in play. The exception to this rule is the goalie. The goalie is a designated player whose main job is to protect the goal from the opponents. The goalie is the last line of defense and can catch or touch the soccer ball with their hands. Players also cannot tackle, push, hit, or knockdown their opponents.

        The typical game play in soccer involves one team that has possession of the ball dribbling the ball and passing it amongst themselves to try and get to where they can kick or head the ball into the goal. The other team is constantly trying to take the ball away. The possession of the ball can change quite often throughout the game.
        
        Each soccer team has eleven players including the goalie. The winner at the end of the designated time is the team with the most goals. Each goal counts for one point. If there is a tie, there may be an overtime or there may a shootout to determine the winner.</div>
